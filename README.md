Online closing store website: UML activity diagram for the Customer Role

## 
The UML activity diagram for the Customer role represents the customer's journey within the system, from entering the website to the final step of completing their interaction. The diagram also includes scenarios where the shopping process is interrupted, commonly known as the unhappy path. It illustrates how the customer interacts with the system and the moderator. Notably, this diagram focuses solely on customer-centered activities, while Moderator-Administrator interactions are covered in a separate activity diagram.
